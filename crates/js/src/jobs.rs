//! Job queue (microtask) management.
//!
//! SpiderMonkey requires a job queue to execute promise continuations and other
//! microtasks. This module provides wrappers for configuring and draining the
//! queue.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Use SpiderMonkey's built-in job queue (simplest option):
//! jobs::use_internal_job_queues(cx)?;
//!
//! // After evaluating JS that creates promises, drain the queue:
//! jobs::run_jobs(cx);
//! ```
