//! The monotonic clock, with offsets applied where needed, such as when resuming from a Wizer
//! snapshot.
//!
//! On wasm the monotonic clock is scoped to the instance: it starts again at zero when an instance
//! resumes from a snapshot, while readings taken before the snapshot are still in the heap, in the
//! instance's future. [`record_snapshot_reading`] captures the clock as the snapshot is made and
//! [`resume_from_snapshot`] adds that reading to every reading afterwards, so a resumed instance
//! continues the timeline the snapshot ended on instead of restarting it.
//!
//! SpiderMonkey keeps the same kind of state (GC phase timestamps, the last collection's end) and
//! reads its own copy of the same host clock, so an embedder passes the value
//! [`resume_from_snapshot`] returns on to the engine as well.
