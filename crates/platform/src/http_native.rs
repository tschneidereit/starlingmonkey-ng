    // TODO(keep-alive robustness): idle connection pooling is left enabled (reqwest's
    // default) for performance, but it has a known robustness gap against non-compliant
    // servers. hyper applies RFC 7230 §3.3.3 strictly: a body-exempt response (HEAD, 1xx,
    // 204, 304) has a zero-length body regardless of any `Content-Length`. A server that
    // nevertheless *sends* a body with such a status, such as WPT `status.py`,
    // leaves those bytes unread on the socket; hyper treats the message as
    // complete and returns the connection to the pool. The next request to reuse that
    // connection reads the stale bytes as a status line and fails with a parse error
    // (`hyper::Error(Parse(Version))`). hyper auto-retries idempotent methods on a fresh
    // connection, but a POST is not retried (it may already have been processed), so it
    // surfaces as a spurious network error. Symptom: the `response-null-body` WPT subtests
    // for 204/304 fail intermittently (see their FLAKY expectations).
    //
    // This cannot be fixed through reqwest: it exposes no connection-eviction or
    // idle-flush API, and dropping a body-exempt `Response` unread does not close its
    // connection (hyper considers a length-0 body already complete and pools it anyway).
    // Instead, fixing this would require building our own pool directly on hyper.
    // See wasmtime PR #12635 for the related "ignore a connection error that arrives after
    // the response" technique.
    // Ideally this is fixed upstream in reqwest/hyper (detect leftover bytes after a
    // body-exempt response and refuse to pool that connection) rather than by hand-rolling
    // a client here.
