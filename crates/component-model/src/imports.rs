//! The JavaScript→host import path and native synthesis of import modules.
//!
//! A componentized application imports WIT functions and resources by importing
//! them from ES modules named after their WIT interface (e.g.
//! `import { f } from "test:iface/x"`).
//!
//! Those modules are synthesized natively at init time
//! ([`synthesize_import_modules`]): each export is a [`Function::new_callback`]
//! whose callback runs [`dispatch_import`], which routes to the sync or async
//! host-call path by the import's declared mode. A synthesized module holds a
//! function per freestanding import and a class per resource, with constructor,
//! methods, statics and a hidden drop callback.
//!
//! Lowering the JS arguments, calling the host and lifting the result back is
//! driven by `wit-dylib`'s generated code, which exists only in the dylib. To
//! keep the path natively testable it goes through a pluggable [`ImportInvoker`],
//! and the world's structure is described by a crate-local [`WorldDesc`], so this
//! module never names a wit-dylib type. [`call_import_from_js`] and
//! [`call_import_from_js_async`] only push the raw JS arguments onto a
//! [`CallStack`] and pop the single lifted result off it. Everything in between
//! happens inside the invoker.
