//! Driving a CLI application's `run` export.

//! `wasi:cli/run.run()` dispatches to a JavaScript `run` function the
//! application exports from its main module, resolved as a flat `ns.run` rather
//! than an interface-qualified member. [`run_main_export`] resolves and drives
//! it for the runtime's own `wasi:cli/run` export in an instance whose top level
