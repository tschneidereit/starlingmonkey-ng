//! Running `FinalizationRegistry` cleanup callbacks.
//!
//! SpiderMonkey collects a registry's dead targets but runs none of its
//! callbacks itself. It hands the host a `doCleanup` function per registry with
//! work pending, and calling that function runs the callbacks. [`install`]
//! registers the hook that receives those functions, and [`run_pending`] calls
//! them.
//!
//! The hook runs inside a collection, so it only pushes `do_cleanup` onto the
//! [`FinalizationState`] queue and returns. The queued functions are traced until they
//! run, since nothing else keeps them alive.
