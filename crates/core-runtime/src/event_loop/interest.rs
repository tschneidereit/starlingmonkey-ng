//! Interest tracking for the event loop.
//!
//! An [`InterestTracker`] counts external "keep-alive" requests — things
//! that should prevent the event loop from exiting even when no tasks are
//! queued. Builtins acquire an [`InterestHandle`] when they start an
//! operation; dropping the handle releases the interest.
//!
//! The handle owns a reference to the acquiring loop's counter, so the
//! release always lands on the right loop no matter where the handle is
//! dropped. That matters in cases where multiple incoming events are handled with multiple event
//! loops, but sharing the same global object: a promise reaction holding a handle can run during
//! another event loop's turn, and a release routed through "the active loop" would decrement that
//! other loop's counter, hanging the acquiring loop and underflowing the active one.
//!
//! The event loop is considered alive when either the task queue has
//! pending work or the interest count is positive.
