//! Per-invocation state for the event loop.
//!
//! An [`InvocationState`] bundles an [`EventLoop`] with per-invocation
//! metadata. Each incoming request, export call, or CLI script execution
//! gets its own `InvocationState`. The embedding layer (starling binary,
//! libstarling, componentize-js) decides how many invocations run
//! concurrently and schedules them.
//!
//! Note: right now there's no additional metadata, but in the future this
//! will include things like information about which incoming event started
//! an invocation.
//!
//! [`InvocationRegistry`] tracks all live `InvocationState` instances so
//! the GC can trace their event loops during garbage collection.
