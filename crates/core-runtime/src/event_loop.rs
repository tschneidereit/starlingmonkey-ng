//! Event loop for the StarlingMonkey runtime.
//!
//! The event loop manages asynchronous tasks (timers, I/O completions, promise
//! resolutions, etc.) and drives them to completion. It is designed around three
//! layered abstractions:
//!
//! 1. **[`Task`] trait** — extensible interface that builtins implement. The
//!    event loop knows nothing about specific task types; it just stores trait
//!    objects and runs them when ready.
//!
//! 2. **[`EventLoop`] struct** — platform-independent task registry. Manages
//!    queuing, cancellation, readiness signaling, timer advancement, GC
//!    tracing, and notification of idle drivers via [`event_listener::Event`].
//!
//! 3. **[`run_to_completion`]** — a single `async fn` driver that calls
//!    [`EventLoop::step`] in a loop and, when idle, races the next timer
//!    deadline against a readiness notification. Platform differences are
//!    confined to the sleep function and the executor:
//!    - `wasi`: `wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock.wait-for` for sleep,
//!      `wasip3::wit_bindgen::spawn` as executor.
//!    - `native`: the caller provides a proper async sleep (e.g.
//!      `tokio::time::sleep`) and executor (e.g.
//!      `tokio::runtime::Runtime::block_on`). This keeps the core runtime
//!      free of any specific async runtime dependency.
//!
//! # Task lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! queue(task) → Queued → signal_ready(id) → Ready → step() → run(scope)
//!                 │                                              │
//!                 └── cancel(id) ───────────────────── dropped ◄─┘
//! ```
//!
//! Tasks start in the **Queued** state. External events (timer expiry, I/O
//! completion, a future resolving) move them to **Ready** via
//! [`EventLoop::signal_ready`]. Each [`EventLoop::step`] runs the batch of tasks that are ready
//! at its start. Alternatively, embedders can use [`EventLoop::pop_ready`] to drive the loop by
//! hand.
//!
//! Running consumes the task, repeating behaviors like
//! `setInterval` re-queue themselves inside `run()`.
//!
//! # GC integration
//!
//! Tasks that hold references to GC-managed JS objects must trace them in
//! [`Task::trace`]. The [`EventLoop`] is registered as a SpiderMonkey
//! extra-roots tracer so that all live tasks are traced during both minor
//! and major GC.
