//! Private-data borrow tracking.
//!
//! Private data lives behind a raw pointer in a reserved slot, so the borrow
//! checker cannot see aliasing of it: `data()` and `data_mut()` both conjure a
//! reference from that pointer, and one JS object is reachable through any
//! number of copyable handles. The hazard is *reentrancy* — a `&mut self`
//! method borrows `this`, then code touches the same object's data again while
//! that borrow is live.
//!
//! `set_private` installs a per-object borrow flag (mirroring `RefCell`) that
//! `data()`/`data_mut()`/`get_this_data*` check, so an overlapping conflicting
//! borrow panics instead of aliasing. Note that we can't test the panic behavior,
//! since the test process is aborted completely because unwinding across the FFI
//! boundary doesn't work.
// This file contains nothing platform-specific, so skip it on wasm32.
