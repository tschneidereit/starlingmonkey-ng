//! Handing a JS body stream to the host transport as an outgoing body.

//! This implements `HTTP-network fetch` Step 8.5's "transmit _request_'s `body`"
//! (<https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-fetch>), i.e.
//! `incrementally read a body` and the `incrementally-read loop`
//! (<https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#body-incrementally-read>): each chunk is

//!
//! A body whose stream came straight from the host and has never been read is
//! handed through untouched. Otherwise, the stream is pumped: chunks from an
//! internal reader are sent through a channel which the platform transport reads
//! as it sends the body.
