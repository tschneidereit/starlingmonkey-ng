//!
//! The spec models these containers as having `[[queue]]` (a list of
//! "value-with-size" records) and `[[queueTotalSize]]` (a number) internal
//! slots, and defines the queue operations (`EnqueueValueWithSize`,
//! `DequeueValue`, `PeekQueueValue`, `ResetQueue`) generically over any such
//! container. The [`QueueWithSizes`] trait captures that shared shape so the
//! operations in [`crate::algorithms`] can run against either controller.
