//! Which route an outgoing body takes to the wire: handed over whole (the host shortcut) or pumped
//! through JS chunk by chunk.
//!
//! Both deliver the same bytes, so nothing a client can see distinguishes them — which is exactly
//! why losing the shortcut needs a test of its own. Without one, a change that started copying every
//! response body through JS would leave every other test green.
//!
//! These run in a test binary of their own because they read process-wide counters
//! (`web_fetch::outgoing_body::paths_taken`), which any other request in flight would perturb. The
//! counters belong to the process, and this file holds a single test, so the counts always belong
//! to the request that just ran. The ports below are this binary's own for the same reason.
