//! Native serve mode: run the content script once (it registers a `fetch`
//! handler with `addEventListener("fetch", …)`), then serve HTTP/1.1 with
//! [`hyper`], dispatching each request as a `fetch` event and responding with the
//! handler's response.
//!
//! Each request runs on its own [`EventLoop`](core_runtime::event_loop::EventLoop), matching the
//! ServiceWorker concurrency model, and requests are served concurrently on the single-threaded
//! async runtime, interleaving at `await` points as each steps its own loop.
//!
//! hyper writes a response body by polling it, and requires it to be `'static`, so a body cannot
//! hold the rooting scope its chunks are produced in. A request therefore hands hyper a
//! [`WireBody`] that reads from a channel. The JS-side work that fills the channel is registered
//! with the serve loop, which drives it until it completes.
