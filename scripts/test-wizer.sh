# Test the Wizer pre-initialization path end to end.
#
# The component exports `wizer-initialize`, which `wasmtime wizer` runs before snapshotting the
# instance's state. That path has no unit-test seam: it only exists as a component export, run by
# an external tool, and what it produces is only meaningfully checked by serving it. So this
# builds the component, snapshots it, and serves the snapshot.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-wizer.sh            # build the component, then run every case
#   ./scripts/test-wizer.sh --no-build # reuse the component already in target/
#
# Requires `wasmtime` on PATH (for both the `wizer` subcommand and `serve`).
