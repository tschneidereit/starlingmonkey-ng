# The componentization suites, one test target each in `componentize/tests/`. Each file's
# module doc describes what it covers. `componentize` is a workspace of its own (see its
# `Cargo.toml`), so its recipes run cargo from its directory rather than with `-p`.
#   - `integration`: the smoke test, one tiny world end to end.
#   - `sync_suite`: every WIT value type, resources, and sync imports.
#   - `async_export`: an `async` export driven through a per-call event loop.
#   - `parity_demo`: an `async` export mixing a timer with a `ReadableStream`,
#                      and two concurrent calls.
#   - `async_import`: an `async` export awaiting a suspending `async` import.
#   - `streams`: the Component Model `stream<T>` and `future<T>` bridge.
#   - `exported_resource`: a guest-owned resource used and dropped by the host.
#   - `cli_run`: a JS module exporting `run`, run via `wasi:cli/run.run()`.
#   - `serve`: a JS module registering a `fetch` listener, served via
#                      `wasi:http/handler.handle()`, and one implementing `handle` itself.
#   - `fetch_streams`: `fetch` with received and returned `stream<u8>` bodies.
#   - `resources`: imported and exported resources across interfaces.
#   - `world_resource`: a resource declared in the world itself.
#   - `surface`: the `--disable` flag and the component's imports.
#   - `values`: flags, keywords, payload-punning variants, and value checks.
#   - `wit_dir`: a WIT directory with `deps/` and two versions of one interface.
#   - `top_level`: relative imports and a top-level `await` during componentization.
#   - `wit_to_ts`: the `.d.ts` generator's snapshots, type-checked with `tsc`.
#
# The suites link every world against one of the two runtime builds, selected
# by STARLING_LINK_MODE: `static` (the default) reads the runtime from
# STARLING_RUNTIME (default target/wasm32-wasip3/release/starling.wasm);
# `dynamic` reads the dylib from STARLING_DYLIB (default
# target/dylib/wasm32-wasip2/libstarling_rt.so) and the wasi-sdk shared libraries from
# WASI_SDK_PATH, which must point at a wasi-sdk 33+ for the `noeh/` ones.
#
# Building the static runtime needs a wasi-sdk 34+, the first with a wasm32-wasip3 sysroot.
#
# ARGS is forwarded to test-componentize-only, and on to libtest, so a name
# filter runs just the matching suite. See that recipe.
#
# Build the static runtime, then run every componentization suite against it.

# Assumes a runtime build in the mode STARLING_LINK_MODE selects (see
# `test-componentize`). Use this to iterate on the tests fast: editing a test
# never rebuilds the runtime or SpiderMonkey. The tests error clearly if the
# runtime build is missing.
#
# `--tests` runs every integration-test target in the crate in one cargo
# invocation, so cargo builds them in parallel and checks the workspace once
# rather than once per suite. Each suite still componentizes its own world once
# via a `OnceCell` and shares it across that suite's tests.
#
# ARGS is forwarded to libtest, so a name filter runs just the matching suite.
# For example, `just test-componentize-only echo_stream_u8` only componentizes
# the `streams` world, and the other suites' caches never initialize.
#
# Each world's componentization is inherent and cannot be shared across distinct
# worlds, but the two cranelift passes over the component that dominate it are
# cached on disk (`shared::engine`), so only a run that rebuilt the runtime pays
# them again.
#
# Run the componentization suites against a prebuilt runtime (no runtime build).

# Generate a TypeScript declaration (`.d.ts`) describing the guest JS module a
# WIT world expects: the named exports the guest implements and the modules it
# may import, with this runtime's WIT->JS value mapping. A world exporting
# `wasi:http/handler` is described with the runtime's `handle`, so it needs the
# runtime build STARLING_RUNTIME names, or the one the componentizer embeds.

#   just ts-bindings --serve                # the built-in serve world
#
# Omitting <world> selects the WIT's default world. `-w` is passed only when a
# world is named, since an empty one would make clap read the `types` subcommand
# as its value.
